The default value is `400` (\"normal\"). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style's resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.",
