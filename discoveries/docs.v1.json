Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's order within the list."
