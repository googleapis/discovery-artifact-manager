A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",

The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The following fields and functions are available for filtering: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = \"ADT\"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date \u003c \"2017-01-02\"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time \u003c \"2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00\"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time \u003c \"2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00\"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = \"ABC\"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(\"123456\", \"MRN\")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.\"priority\"=\"high\"`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.\"priority\":*`."

When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are appended to the corresponding BigQuery tables. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging.

The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `\"query text\"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The fields available for filtering are: - data_id - user_id. For example, `filter=user_id=\\\"user123\\\"`. - archived - archive_time",

The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `\"query text\"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The fields available for filtering are: - user_id. For example, `filter=user_id=\\\"user123\\\"`. - consent_content_version - metadata. For example, `filter=Metadata(\\\"testkey\\\")=\\\"value\\\"` or `filter=HasMetadata(\\\"testkey\\\")`."

The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported. For example, `labels.key=value`."

For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched.

The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `\"query text\"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = \"ADT\"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date \u003c \"2017-01-02\"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time \u003c \"2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00\"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time \u003c \"2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00\"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = \"ABC\"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(\"123456\", \"MRN\")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.\"priority\"=\"high\"`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.\"priority\":*`.",

Implements the FHIR standard search interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search)) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain pagination links. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results.

For a batch bundle or a successful transaction the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.

Implements the FHIR standard search interaction ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search)) using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)). Supports four methods of search defined by the specification: * `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources. * `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified type. * `POST [base]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method across all resources. * `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having the same semantics as the `GET` method for the specified type. The `GET` and `POST` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the search. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The server's capability statement, retrieved through capabilities, indicates what search parameters are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter Registry ([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)). FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition page. Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain pagination links. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results.

                      "description": "Imports resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it's possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.",

The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `\"query text\"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `\"Comment = great\"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e`, `\u003e=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported, for example `labels.key=value`.",
