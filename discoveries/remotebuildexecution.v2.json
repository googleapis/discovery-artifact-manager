In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the inputs, the Command to run, and the Action into the ContentAddressableStorage. It then calls `Execute` with an `action_digest` referring to them. The server will run the action and eventually return the result. The input `Action`'s fields MUST meet the various canonicalization requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has the same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not verify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from another logically equivalent action if they hash differently. Returns a stream of google.longrunning.Operation messages describing the resulting execution, with eventual `response` ExecuteResponse. The `metadata` on the operation is of type ExecuteOperationMetadata. If the client remains connected after the first response is returned after the server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called WaitExecution until the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The operation can also be queried using Operations API. The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the Operations API. Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the action will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto. The possible errors include: * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments are invalid. * `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry. * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run the action. * `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not be started. The client should retry. * `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the worker. * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out. * `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client. This status is only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation method, and it was called for the current execution. In the case of a missing input or command, the server SHOULD additionally send a PreconditionFailure error detail where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a `Violation` with a `type` of `MISSING` and a `subject` of `\"blobs/{hash}/{size}\"` indicating the digest of the missing blob. The server does not need to guarantee that a call to this method leads to at most one execution of the action. The server MAY execute the action multiple times, potentially in parallel.

The server is also responsible for specifying the interpretation of property `value`s. For instance, a property describing how much RAM must be available may be interpreted as allowing a worker with 16GB to fulfill a request for 8GB, while a property describing the OS environment on which the action must be performed may require an exact match with the worker's OS. The server MAY use the `value` of one or more properties to determine how it sets up the execution environment, such as by making specific system files available to the worker. Both names and values are typically case-sensitive.

A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh. When a server completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the result in the ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and correct.",

The timeout is a part of the Action message, and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not, running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact that the timeout is too short.

      "description": "A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or more children FileNodes, DirectoryNodes and SymlinkNodes. Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name. A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form. As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // (Directory proto) { files: [ { name: \"bar\", digest: { hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\", size: 65534 }, node_properties: [ { \"name\": \"MTime\", \"value\": \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" } ] } ], directories: [ { name: \"foo\", digest: { hash: \"4cf2eda940...\", size: 43 } } ] } // (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43) { files: [ { name: \"baz\", digest: { hash: \"b2c941073e...\", size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } ```"

The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.",
