This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible \"state_change\" values when compare_duration is specified: * \"CHANGED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * \"UNCHANGED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * \"ADDED\": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * \"REMOVED\": indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time.",

                      "description": "Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:` * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`, `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : \"\"` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : \"\"` * resource: * resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:` * resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`, `:`",

Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible \"state_change\" values when compare_duration is specified: * \"ADDED\": indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at read_time. * \"REMOVED\": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * \"ACTIVE\": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.",

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
