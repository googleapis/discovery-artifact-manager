Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:` * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.

Examples: `update_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `create_time = 1560208038000` * iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
