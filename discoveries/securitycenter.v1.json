A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",

Examples: `event_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`, `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003e=`, `\u003c=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : \"\"` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : \"\"` * resource: * resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:`",

If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is \"UNUSED\", which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time.
