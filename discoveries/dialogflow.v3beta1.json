When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active.

If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment associated with the `sys.no-match-1`/`sys.no-input-1` handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The `sys.no-match-2`/`sys.no-input-2` handler (if defined) will respond to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on. A `sys.no-match-default` or `sys.no-input-default` handler will be used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed. A `sys.invalid-parameter` handler can be defined to handle the case where the parameter values have been `invalidated` by webhook. For example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated with the `sys.invalid-parameter` handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt. If the event handler for the corresponding event can't be found on the parameter, `initial_prompt_fulfillment` will be re-prompted."

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

You can also create your own custom entities for matching custom data.
