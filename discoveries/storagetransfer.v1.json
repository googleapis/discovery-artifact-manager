When you cancel an operation, the currently running transfer is interrupted. For recurring transfer jobs, the next instance of the transfer job will still run. For example, if your job is configured to run every day at 1pm and you cancel Monday's operation at 1:05pm, Monday's transfer will stop. However, a transfer job will still be attempted on Tuesday. This applies only to currently running operations. If an operation is not currently running, `cancel` does nothing. *Caution:* Canceling a transfer job can leave your data in an unknown state. We recommend that you restore the state at both the destination and the source after the `cancel` request completes so that your data is in a consistent state. When you cancel a job, the next job computes a delta of files and may repair any inconsistent state. For instance, if you run a job every day, and today's job found 10 new files and transferred five files before you canceled the job, tomorrow's transfer operation will compute a new delta with the five files that were not copied today plus any new files discovered tomorrow.",

For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

Objects must not start with one of the matching `exclude_prefixes` for inclusion in a transfer. The following are requirements of `exclude_prefixes`: * Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If include_prefixes is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`. The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000. For more information, see [Filtering objects from transfers](/storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers).",
