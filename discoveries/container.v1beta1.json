For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

(maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time.
