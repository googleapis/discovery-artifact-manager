An app is considered to be in active use if it is displaying any activity or executing any foreground service. * `userPerceivedCrashRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `userPerceivedCrashRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. Not supported in HOURLY granularity. * `userPerceivedCrashRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `userPerceivedCrashRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. Not supported in HOURLY granularity. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `crashRate` and `userPerceivedCrashRate` metrics. A user is counted in this metric if they used the app actively during the aggregation period. An app is considered to be in active use if it is displaying any activity or executing any foreground service. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times. The value is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, 100, 1,000 or 1,000,000, depending on the magnitude of the value. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device, e.g., 26. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. The form of the identifier is 'deviceBrand/device', where deviceBrand corresponds to Build.BRAND and device corresponds to Build.DEVICE, e.g., google/coral. * `deviceBrand` (string): unique identifier of the user's device brand, e.g., google. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also known as form factor) of the user's device, e.g., PHONE. * `countryCode` (string): the country or region of the user's device based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United States). * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., \"Exynos 2100\". [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake` (string): Make of the device's CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the device's CPU, e.g., \"Kryo 240\". * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device's GPU, e.g., ARM. * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device's GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion` (string): Version of the device's GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan version of the device, e.g., \"4198400\". * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the device, e.g., \"196610\". * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL, LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors contains unnormalized version (absolute counts) of crashes. * vitals.errors contains normalized metrics about ANRs, another stability metric.",

The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -\u003e `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -\u003e `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -\u003e `2.5E+8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -\u003e `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` \u003c-\u003e `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range."

Example: `apiLevel = 28 OR apiLevel = 29`. * `versionCode`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested app version codes only. Example: `versionCode = 123 OR versionCode = 456`. * `deviceModel`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested devices. Example: `deviceModel = \"google/walleye\" OR deviceModel = \"google/marlin\"`. * `deviceBrand`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested device brands. Example: `deviceBrand = \"Google\". * `deviceType`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested device types. Example: `deviceType = \"PHONE\"`. * `errorIssueType`: Matches error reports of the requested types only. Valid candidates: `JAVA_CRASH`, `NATIVE_CRASH`, `ANR`. Example: `errorIssueType = JAVA_CRASH OR errorIssueType = NATIVE_CRASH`. * `errorIssueId`: Matches error reports belonging to the requested error issue ids only. Example: `errorIssueId = 1234 OR errorIssueId = 4567`. * `appProcessState`: Matches error reports on the process state of an app, indicating whether an app runs in the foreground (user-visible) or background. Valid candidates: `FOREGROUND`, `BACKGROUND`. Example: `appProcessState = FOREGROUND`. * `isUserPerceived`: Matches error reports that are user-perceived. It is not accompanied by any operators. Example: `isUserPerceived`. ** Supported operators:** * Comparison operators: The only supported comparison operator is equality. The filtered field must appear on the left hand side of the comparison. * Logical Operators: Logical operators `AND` and `OR` can be used to build complex filters following a conjunctive normal form (CNF), i.e., conjunctions of disjunctions. The `OR` operator takes precedence over `AND` so the use of parenthesis is not necessary when building CNF. The `OR` operator is only supported to build disjunctions that apply to the same field, e.g., `versionCode = 123 OR versionCode = ANR`. The filter expression `versionCode = 123 OR errorIssueType = ANR` is not valid. ** Examples ** Some valid filtering expressions: * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = ANR` * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH` * `versionCode = 123 AND (errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH)`",

Example: `errorIssueType = CRASH OR errorIssueType = ANR`. * `appProcessState`: Matches error issues on the process state of an app, indicating whether an app runs in the foreground (user-visible) or background. Valid candidates: `FOREGROUND`, `BACKGROUND`. Example: `appProcessState = FOREGROUND`. * `isUserPerceived`: Matches error issues that are user-perceived. It is not accompanied by any operators. Example: `isUserPerceived`. ** Supported operators:** * Comparison operators: The only supported comparison operator is equality. The filtered field must appear on the left hand side of the comparison. * Logical Operators: Logical operators `AND` and `OR` can be used to build complex filters following a conjunctive normal form (CNF), i.e., conjunctions of disjunctions. The `OR` operator takes precedence over `AND` so the use of parenthesis is not necessary when building CNF. The `OR` operator is only supported to build disjunctions that apply to the same field, e.g., `versionCode = 123 OR errorIssueType = ANR` is not a valid filter. ** Examples ** Some valid filtering expressions: * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = ANR` * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH` * `versionCode = 123 AND (errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH)`",
