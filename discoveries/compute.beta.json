For example, disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams. - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504. - connect-failure: a retry is attempted on failures connecting to the instance or endpoint. For example, connection timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you can retry is error code 409. - refused-stream: a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry. - cancelled: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled. - deadline-exceeded: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded. - internal: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to internal. - resource-exhausted: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to resource-exhausted. - unavailable: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable.

This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

However, if specified in both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.",

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`.

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax.

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",

Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`."

              "description": "A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq \"double quoted literal\"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne \"literal\")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name \"instance\", you would use `name ne .*instance`.",
