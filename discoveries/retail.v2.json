Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one.

In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response will be determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * \"rating\", enable_dynamic_position = true * \"price\", enable_dynamic_position = false * \"brands\", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which will generate a facet 'gender'. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be (\"price\", \"brands\", \"rating\", \"gender\") or (\"price\", \"brands\", \"gender\", \"rating\") depends on how Google Retail Search orders \"gender\" and \"rating\" facets.
