Supported Fields: * `approvalStatus` * `creativeId` * `creativeType` * `dimensions` (input in the form of `{width}x{height}`) * `dynamic` * `entityStatus` * `exchangeReviewStatus` (input in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`) * `lineItemIds` * `maxDuration` (input in the form of `{duration}s`.

Only seconds are supported) * `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) Notes: * For `updateTime`, a creative resource's field value reflects the last time that a creative has been updated, which includes updates made by the system (e.g. creative review updates).

The value assigned will be rounded to whole billable units for the relevant currency by the following rules: any positive value less than a single billable unit will be rounded up to one billable unit and any value larger than a single billable unit will be rounded down to the nearest billable value. For example, if the currency's billable unit is 0.01, and this field is set to 10257770, it will round down to 10250000, a value of 10.25. If set to 505, it will round up to 10000, a value of 0.01.",
