Supported Fields: * `approvalStatus` * `creativeId` * `creativeType` * `dimensions` (input in the form of `{width}x{height}`) * `dynamic` * `entityStatus` * `exchangeReviewStatus` (input in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`) * `lineItemIds` * `maxDuration` (input in the form of `{duration}s`.
