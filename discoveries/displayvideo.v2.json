Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator used on `flight.dateRange.endDate` must be LESS THAN (\u003c). * The operator used on `updateTime` must be `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003e=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003c=)`. * The operator used on `warningMessages` must be `HAS (:)`. * The operators used on all other fields must be `EQUALS (=)`. * Supported properties: - `campaignId` - `displayName` - `insertionOrderId` - `entityStatus` - `lineItemId` - `lineItemType` - `flight.dateRange.endDate` (input formatted as YYYY-MM-DD) - `warningMessages` - `flight.triggerId` - `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) - `targetedChannelId` - `targetedNegativeKeywordListId` Examples: * All line items under an insertion order: `insertionOrderId=\"1234\"` * All `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED` and `LINE_ITEM_TYPE_DISPLAY_DEFAULT` line items under an advertiser: `(entityStatus=\"ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE\" OR entityStatus=\"ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED\") AND lineItemType=\"LINE_ITEM_TYPE_DISPLAY_DEFAULT\"` * All line items whose flight dates end before March 28, 2019: `flight.dateRange.endDate\u003c\"2019-03-28\"` * All line items that have `NO_VALID_CREATIVE` in `warningMessages`: `warningMessages:\"NO_VALID_CREATIVE\"` * All line items with an update time less than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime\u003c=\"2020-11-04T18:54:47Z\"` * All line items with an update time greater than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime\u003e=\"2020-11-04T18:54:47Z\"` * All line items that are using both the specified channel and specified negative keyword list in their targeting: `targetedNegativeKeywordListId=789 AND targetedChannelId=12345` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters."
