Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restriction for the same field must be combined by `OR`. * Restriction for different fields must be combined by `AND`. * Between `(` and `)` there can only be restrictions combined by `OR` for the same field. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)` for the following fields: - `entityStatus` - `creativeType`. - `dimensions` - `minDuration` - `maxDuration` - `approvalStatus` - `exchangeReviewStatus` - `dynamic` - `creativeId` * The operator must be `HAS (:)` for the following fields: - `lineItemIds` * The operator must be `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003e=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003c=)` for the following fields: - `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * For `entityStatus`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `updateTime`, and `dynamic`, there may be at most one restriction. * For `dimensions`, the value is in the form of `\"{width}x{height}\"`. * For `exchangeReviewStatus`, the value is in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`. * For `minDuration` and `maxDuration`, the value is in the form of `\"{duration}s\"`. Only seconds are supported with millisecond granularity. * For `updateTime`, a creative resource's field value reflects the last time that a creative has been updated, which includes updates made by the system (e.g. creative review updates). * There may be multiple `lineItemIds` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible line item IDs. * There may be multiple `creativeId` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible creative IDs. Examples: * All native creatives: `creativeType=\"CREATIVE_TYPE_NATIVE\"` * All active creatives with 300x400 or 50x100 dimensions: `entityStatus=\"ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE\" AND (dimensions=\"300x400\" OR dimensions=\"50x100\")` * All dynamic creatives that are approved by AdX or AppNexus, with a minimum duration of 5 seconds and 200ms. `dynamic=\"true\" AND minDuration=\"5.2s\" AND (exchangeReviewStatus=\"EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED\" OR exchangeReviewStatus=\"EXCHANGE_APPNEXUS-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED\")` * All video creatives that are associated with line item ID 1 or 2: `creativeType=\"CREATIVE_TYPE_VIDEO\" AND (lineItemIds:1 OR lineItemIds:2)` * Find creatives by multiple creative IDs: `creativeId=1 OR creativeId=2` * All creatives with an update time greater than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime\u003e=\"2020-11-04T18:54:47Z\"` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters."
