You can use the wildcard character \"*\" to match all IPs equivalent to \"0/0\" and \"::/0\" together. Examples: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.0/16 or 2001:db8::/32 or 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not properly truncated. For example, 1.2.3.4/24 is accepted as the same address as 1.2.3.0/24. Similarly, for IPv6, 2001:db8::1/32 is accepted as the same address as 2001:db8::/32."
