Dimension values that fall in a bucket get transformed to a new dimension value. For example, if one gives a list of \"0, 1, 3, 4, 7\", then we return the following buckets: - bucket #1: values \u003c 0, dimension value \"\u003c0\" - bucket #2: values in [0,1), dimension value \"0\" - bucket #3: values in [1,3), dimension value \"1-2\" - bucket #4: values in [3,4), dimension value \"3\" - bucket #5: values in [4,7), dimension value \"4-6\" - bucket #6: values \u003e= 7, dimension value \"7+\" NOTE: If you are applying histogram mutation on any dimension, and using that dimension in sort, you will want to use the sort type `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` for that purpose.

For example the ascending dictionary order is: \"\u003c50\", \"1001+\", \"121-1000\", \"50-120\" And the ascending `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` order is: \"\u003c50\", \"50-120\", \"121-1000\", \"1001+\" The client has to explicitly request `\"orderType\": \"HISTOGRAM_BUCKET\"` for a histogram-mutated dimension.",
