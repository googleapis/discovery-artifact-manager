A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

By Alpha, all significant design issues are resolved and we are in the process of verifying functionality. Alpha customers need to apply for access, agree to applicable terms, and have their projects allowlisted. Alpha releases don't have to be feature complete, no SLAs are provided, and there are no technical support obligations, but they will be far enough along that customers can actually use them in test environments or for limited-use tests -- just like they would in normal production cases.",
            "Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any customer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations in a Beta release. Products will be complete from a feature perspective, but may have some open outstanding issues. Beta releases are suitable for limited production use cases.",
