A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Service to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created Services. Additional information on the failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`."
