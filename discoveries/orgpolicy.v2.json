Policies are inherited down the resource hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details about the inheritance rules please read about `policies`. `Constraints` have a default behavior determined by the `constraint_default` field, which is the enforcement behavior that is used in the absence of a `policy` being defined or inherited for the resource in question.",
