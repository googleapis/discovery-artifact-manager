(c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.

For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.

      "description": "Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ..."

For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` \"color\": { \"red\": 1, \"green\": 0, \"blue\": 0, \"alpha\": 0.5 } ```"

To filter reactions by emoji and user, use the `AND` operator, such as `emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" AND user.name = \"users/AAAAAA\"`. If your query uses both `AND` and `OR`, group them with parentheses. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` user.name = \"users/{user}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR emoji.unicode = \"👍\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" AND user.name = \"users/{user}\" (emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\") AND user.name = \"users/{user}\" ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" AND emoji.unicode = \"👍\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" AND emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR user.name = \"users/{user}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\" OR user.name = \"users/{user}\" emoji.unicode = \"🙂\" OR emoji.custom_emoji.uid = \"{uid}\" AND user.name = \"users/{user}\" ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error."

For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported.
