For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported.

You can use the greater than operator `\u003e` to list messages that were created after a timestamp, or the less than operator `\u003c` to list messages that were created before a timestamp.

You can only specify one `thread.name` per query. To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00\" create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00\" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00+00:00\" AND create_time \u003c \"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error."

For an example, see [ Create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). When creating a membership, if the specified member has their auto-accept policy turned off, then they're invited, and must accept the space invitation before joining. Otherwise, creating a membership adds the member directly to the specified space. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users) and the `chat.memberships` (for human membership) or `chat.memberships.app` (for app membership) scope. To specify the member to add, set the `membership.member.name` in the `CreateMembershipRequest`: - To add the calling app to a space or a direct message between two human users, use `users/app`. Unable to add other apps to the space. - To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`.",

For example, if the first column is taller than the second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain a different number of widgets, you can't define rows or align widgets between the columns. Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user's screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 320 dp.

(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.
