For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported.

Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color.

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.
