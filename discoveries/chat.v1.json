For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ...",

For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.
