For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` is either the `{person_id}` for the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from the People API, or the `id` for the [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Admin SDK Directory API. For example, if the People API `Person` `resourceName` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by including a membership with `users/123456789` as the `member.name`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies or guest access aren't supported.

You can use the greater than operator `\u003e` to list messages that were created after a timestamp, or the less than operator `\u003c` to list messages that were created before a timestamp. To filter messages within a time interval, use the `AND` operator between two timestamps. To filter by thread, specify the `thread.name`, formatted as `spaces/{space}/threads/{thread}`. You can only specify one `thread.name` per query. To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00\" create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00\" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 create_time \u003e \"2012-04-21T11:30:00+00:00\" AND create_time \u003c \"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error."

    "Color": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ...",

(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.
