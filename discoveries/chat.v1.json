For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` is either the `{person_id}` for the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from the People API, or the `id` for the [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Admin SDK Directory API. For example, if the People API `Person` `resourceName` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by including a membership with `users/123456789` as the `member.name`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned.

By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ..."

Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

      "description": "The `Columns` widget displays up to 2 columns in a card message or dialog. You can add widgets to each column; the widgets appear in the order that they are specified. The height of each column is determined by the taller column. For example, if the first column is taller than the second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain a different number of widgets, you can't define rows or align widgets between the columns. Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user's screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 320 dp. To include more than 2 columns, or to use rows, use the `Grid` widget. Supported by Chat apps, but not Google Workspace Add-ons."
