CSS classes: * `issue-detail` - top level container for the detail of the issue * `callout-banners` - section of the `issue-detail` with callout banners * `callout-banner` - single callout banner, inside `callout-banners` * `callout-banner-info` - callout with important information (default) * `callout-banner-warning` - callout with a warning * `callout-banner-error` - callout informing about an error (most severe) * `issue-content` - section of the `issue-detail`, contains multiple `content-element` * `content-element` - content element such as a list, link or paragraph, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes` - unordered list with items describing root causes of the issue, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes-intro` - intro text before the `root-causes` list, inside `issue-content` * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example 'image\\_link' * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example '0-1000 kg' * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example '?' or 'i'. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the '?' as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the 'i' as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future. To make sure that a new content element does not break your style, you can hide everything with this class.",

This method should be called after the merchant verifies that they are able and ready to start shipping the order. This method blocks until a response is received from the payment processsor. If this method succeeds, the merchant is guaranteed to receive funds for the order after shipment. If the request fails, it can be retried or the order may be cancelled. This method cannot be called after the entire order is already shipped. A rejected error code is returned when the payment service provider has declined the charge. This indicates a problem between the PSP and either the merchant's or customer's account. Sometimes this error will be resolved by the customer. We recommend retrying these errors once per day or cancelling the order with reason `failedToCaptureFunds` if the items cannot be held."
