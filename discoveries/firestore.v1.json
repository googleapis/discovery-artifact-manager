Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b \u003e 2 AND __name__ \u003e /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b \u003e 10`.

      "description": "A bloom filter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter). The bloom filter hashes the entries with MD5 and treats the resulting 128-bit hash as 2 distinct 64-bit hash values, interpreted as unsigned integers using 2's complement encoding. These two hash values, named `h1` and `h2`, are then used to compute the `hash_count` hash values using the formula, starting at `i=0`: h(i) = h1 + (i * h2) These resulting values are then taken modulo the number of bits in the bloom filter to get the bits of the bloom filter to test for the given entry.",
