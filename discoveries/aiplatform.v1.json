For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ..."

      "description": "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.

Field-restricted queries and filters can be combined using `AND` to form a conjunction. A field query is in the form FIELD:QUERY. This implicitly checks if QUERY exists as a substring within Feature's FIELD. The QUERY and the FIELD are converted to a sequence of words (i.e. tokens) for comparison. This is done by: * Removing leading/trailing whitespace and tokenizing the search value. Characters that are not one of alphanumeric `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, underscore `_`, or asterisk `*` are treated as delimiters for tokens. `*` is treated as a wildcard that matches characters within a token. * Ignoring case. * Prepending an asterisk to the first and appending an asterisk to the last token in QUERY. A QUERY must be either a singular token or a phrase. A phrase is one or multiple words enclosed in double quotation marks (\"). With phrases, the order of the words is important. Words in the phrase must be matching in order and consecutively. Supported FIELDs for field-restricted queries: * `feature_id` * `description` * `entity_type_id` Examples: * `feature_id: foo` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo` (eg. `foo`, `foofeature`, `barfoo`). * `feature_id: foo*feature` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo*feature` (eg. `foobarfeature`). * `feature_id: foo AND description: bar` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo` and description containing the substring `bar`. Besides field queries, the following exact-match filters are supported. The exact-match filters do not support wildcards. Unlike field-restricted queries, exact-match filters are case-sensitive. * `feature_id`: Supports = comparisons. * `description`: Supports = comparisons. Multi-token filters should be enclosed in quotes. * `entity_type_id`: Supports = comparisons. * `value_type`: Supports = and != comparisons. * `labels`: Supports key-value equality as well as key presence. * `featurestore_id`: Supports = comparisons. Examples: * `description = \"foo bar\"` --\u003e Any Feature with description exactly equal to `foo bar` * `value_type = DOUBLE` --\u003e Features whose type is DOUBLE. * `labels.active = yes AND labels.env = prod` --\u003e Features having both (active: yes) and (env: prod) labels. * `labels.env: *` --\u003e Any Feature which has a label with `env` as the key.",

Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = \"2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00\"` * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.\"field:1\".number_value = 10.0` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`).

Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = \"2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00\"` * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.\"field:1\".number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Artifacts based on the contexts to which they belong, use the function operator with the full resource name `in_context()`. For example: `in_context(\"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\")` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`).

Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = \"2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00\"`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0`. In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.\"field:1\".number_value = 10.0` * **Parent Child filtering**: To filter Contexts based on parent-child relationship use the HAS operator as follows: ``` parent_contexts: \"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\" child_contexts: \"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\" ``` Each of the above supported filters can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`).
