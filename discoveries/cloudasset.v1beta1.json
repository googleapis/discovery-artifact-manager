A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: \"E3\" value: \"E4\" inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: \"E1\"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-\u003e{F1, F2}; F1-\u003e{P1}; F2-\u003e{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"under:organizations/O1\"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: \"under:projects/P3\"} {denied_values: \"under:folders/F2\"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.
