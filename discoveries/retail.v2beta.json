API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using \"default_branch\" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.",

Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * \"rating\", enable_dynamic_position = true * \"price\", enable_dynamic_position = false * \"brands\", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which generates a facet \"gender\".
