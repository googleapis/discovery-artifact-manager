The indexing system stores the version from the datasource as a byte string and compares the Item version in the index to the version of the queued Item using lexical ordering. Cloud Search Indexing won't delete any queued item with a version value that is less than or equal to the version of the currently indexed item. The maximum length for this field is 1024 bytes. For information on how item version affects the deletion process, refer to [Handle revisions after manual deletes](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/operations)."
