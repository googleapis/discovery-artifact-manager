For example, you might associate *p0* with *0* and define another enum pair such as *p1* and *1*. You must use the integer value in combination with ordered ranking to set the ranking of a given value relative to other enumerated values for the same property name. Here, a ranking order of DESCENDING for *priority* properties results in a ranking boost for items indexed with a value of *p0* compared to items indexed with a value of *p1*.

To index large content: 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.upload with the item name to begin an upload session and retrieve the UploadItemRef. 1. Call media.upload to upload the content, as a streaming request, using the same resource name from the UploadItemRef from step 1. 1. Call indexing.datasources.items.index to index the item. Populate the [ItemContent](/cloud-search/docs/reference/rest/v1/indexing.datasources.items#ItemContent) with the UploadItemRef from step 1.
