A card has two views, collapsed and detailed. If there are more than 1 card, the cards are show as a list of collapsed views. The end user can expand into the detailed view for each of those cards. In the detailed view, developers have the freedom to use a variety of \"widgets\" to construct it. The model here is to restrict (make consistent for end users) the navigation of the N cards but providing developers the freedom to build the detailed view that can best represent their use case/content. Go http://go/aoig-widgets1 to see the mocks. Post v1, we plan to support new AddOn use cases that will require different and separate 'templates'. For example, a compose triggered AddOn which will support a new set of use cases with different user interaction patterns. As a result, we will likely need a very different template than this one."

For example, you might associate *p0* with *0* and define another enum pair such as *p1* and *1*. You must use the integer value in combination with ordered ranking to set the ranking of a given value relative to other enumerated values for the same property name. Here, a ranking order of DESCENDING for *priority* properties results in a ranking boost for items indexed with a value of *p0* compared to items indexed with a value of *p1*.

(1): Item \"fields\" are common to items of all message types (e.g. mail, chat, task, etc.) and are identified by the ItemFieldSpec.FetchType enum when fetching Items. (2): Item \"attributes\" represent data associated with an Item that is stored on behalf of the client but to which the fusebox and storage layers are otherwise agnostic. (3): Item \"parts\" are application-defined protocol buffers that affect how the Item is indexed. Item parts are referenced as extensions to the ItemParts message.

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ...",

More than one key field may be set as long as all key values refer to the same object. All objects in storage have unique server_id keys. All MultiKeys returned from storage to storage clients will always have the server_id field set. When creating an object, if a MultiKey without a server_id is supplied to storage, the storage system will auto-assign a server ID to the new object. For all other storage requests (i.e. those not creating new objects), clients may omit server_id (as long as they supply another key). Instead of server ids, clients can specify string based client_assigned_perm_id keys. Mail message drafts are a prime example of these kinds of objects. Each time a user saves a new version of a draft, the storage system needs to create a new object with the updated draft content and needs to delete the object containing the old content. The new object gets a new SERVER_ID but should get the same CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID as the now-deleted object containing the old content. Carrying forward the perm ID allows it to be used to consistently refer to the same logical object across revisions. These perm IDs save sync clients from having to deal with changing object IDs. For example, assume there's a mail message in storage with SERVER_ID = 123 and CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID = \"foo\". The following are all valid ways of addressing the object using MultiKeys: 1) MultiKey { server_id = 123 } 2) MultiKey { server_id = 123, client_assigned_perm_id = \"foo\" } 3) MultiKey { client_assigned_perm_id = \"foo\" } Multikeys are never serialized in the storage. The individual keys are extracted and processed separately. Both the integer ids as well as string ids are indexed for efficient retrieval using the same fields in the backend. See go/tingle-multikeys for more information on background and motivation."
