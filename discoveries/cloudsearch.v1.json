A card has two views, collapsed and detailed. If there are more than 1 card, the cards are show as a list of collapsed views. The end user can expand into the detailed view for each of those cards. In the detailed view, developers have the freedom to use a variety of \"widgets\" to construct it. The model here is to restrict (make consistent for end users) the navigation of the N cards but providing developers the freedom to build the detailed view that can best represent their use case/content. Go http://go/aoig-widgets1 to see the mocks. Post v1, we plan to support new AddOn use cases that will require different and separate 'templates'.

Note: QuotedMessageMetadata proto is similar to Message proto with less field. Reasons to differtiate QuotedMessageMetadata from Message are: 1. Not all fields for original message is applicable for quoted message. (E.g. reactions, is_inline_reply, etc.), thus separting out for confusion. 2. We don't support nested message quoting. For more detailed discussion, please see http://shortn/_VsSXQb2C7P.

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red \u003c\u003c 16) | (green \u003c\u003c 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i \u003c missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ...",

For example, if we are linking to a photo album, the Embed may include the album ID and gaia ID of the creator. Clients that understand the Embed type within the Attachment may construct and/or decorate their link appropriately e.g. to make use of type-specific functionality or first-party integrations. The link_target and (if appropriate) display_url fields must still be set even when an Attachment is present, so that clients who do not know how to interpret the Attachment can fall back to those fields, and render the Segment as an ordinary web link. N.B. Even when an Attachment is present, the intention of a \"LINK\" Segment is for the Segment to be presented inline with the rest of the text of a post or comment, with a clickable link or other UI suitable for inlining (though the client may modify the UI based on Attachment data, e.g. to add appropriate hovers, icons, etc.). When an entity is intended to be rendered separately from the main body of the post/comment, a separate Attachment proto can be added outside the set of Segments. N.B. Within the Attachment, fields of EmbedClientItem have their own visibility annotations, which should be enforced separately from Segment visibility annotations.

More than one key field may be set as long as all key values refer to the same object. All objects in storage have unique server_id keys. All MultiKeys returned from storage to storage clients will always have the server_id field set. When creating an object, if a MultiKey without a server_id is supplied to storage, the storage system will auto-assign a server ID to the new object. For all other storage requests (i.e. those not creating new objects), clients may omit server_id (as long as they supply another key). Instead of server ids, clients can specify string based client_assigned_perm_id keys. Mail message drafts are a prime example of these kinds of objects. Each time a user saves a new version of a draft, the storage system needs to create a new object with the updated draft content and needs to delete the object containing the old content. The new object gets a new SERVER_ID but should get the same CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID as the now-deleted object containing the old content. Carrying forward the perm ID allows it to be used to consistently refer to the same logical object across revisions. These perm IDs save sync clients from having to deal with changing object IDs. For example, assume there's a mail message in storage with SERVER_ID = 123 and CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID = \"foo\". The following are all valid ways of addressing the object using MultiKeys: 1) MultiKey { server_id = 123 } 2) MultiKey { server_id = 123, client_assigned_perm_id = \"foo\" } 3) MultiKey { client_assigned_perm_id = \"foo\" } Multikeys are never serialized in the storage. The individual keys are extracted and processed separately. Both the integer ids as well as string ids are indexed for efficient retrieval using the same fields in the backend. See go/tingle-multikeys for more information on background and motivation.",
