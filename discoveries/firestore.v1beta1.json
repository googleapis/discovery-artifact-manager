The ordering of the result set is based on the `ORDER BY` clause of the original query. ``` SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b \u003e 2 ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC; ``` This query's results are ordered by `(b ASC, __name__ ASC)`. Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b \u003e 2 AND __name__ \u003e /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b \u003e 10`. Unlike `OFFSET` which requires scanning over the first N results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical position. This position is not required to match an actual result, it will scan forward from this position to find the next document. Requires: * The number of values cannot be greater than the number of fields specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.",
