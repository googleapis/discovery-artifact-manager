For example, the structured field `\"foo\" : { map_value: { \"x&y\" : { string_value: \"hello\" }}}` would be represented by the field path `foo.x&y`. Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\\`.
