Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified. For example: * `ORDER BY a` becomes `ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC` * `ORDER BY a DESC` becomes `ORDER BY a DESC, __name__ DESC` * `WHERE a \u003e 1` becomes `WHERE a \u003e 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC` * `WHERE __name__ \u003e ...
