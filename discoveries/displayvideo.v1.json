Display & Video 360 transcodes the main asset into a number of alternative versions that use different file formats or have different properties (resolution, audio bit rate, and video bit rate), each designed for specific video players or bandwidths. These transcodes give a publisher's system more options to choose from for each impression on your video and ensures that the appropriate file serves based on the viewer’s connection and screen size.
