Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The `lineItemIds` field must use the `HAS (:)` operator. * The `updateTime` field must use the `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003e=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (\u003c=)` operators. * All other fields must use the `EQUALS (=)` operator. * For `entityStatus`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `updateTime`, and `dynamic` fields, there may be at most one restriction. Supported Fields: * `approvalStatus` * `creativeId` * `creativeType` * `dimensions` (input in the form of `{width}x{height}`) * `dynamic` * `entityStatus` * `exchangeReviewStatus` (input in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`) * `lineItemIds` * `maxDuration` (input in the form of `{duration}s`. Only seconds are supported) * `minDuration` (input in the form of `{duration}s`. Only seconds are supported) * `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) Notes: * For `updateTime`, a creative resource's field value reflects the last time that a creative has been updated, which includes updates made by the system (e.g. creative review updates). Examples: * All native creatives: `creativeType=\"CREATIVE_TYPE_NATIVE\"` * All active creatives with 300x400 or 50x100 dimensions: `entityStatus=\"ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE\" AND (dimensions=\"300x400\" OR dimensions=\"50x100\")` * All dynamic creatives that are approved by AdX or AppNexus, with a minimum duration of 5 seconds and 200ms: `dynamic=\"true\" AND minDuration=\"5.2s\" AND (exchangeReviewStatus=\"EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED\" OR exchangeReviewStatus=\"EXCHANGE_APPNEXUS-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED\")` * All video creatives that are associated with line item ID 1 or 2: `creativeType=\"CREATIVE_TYPE_VIDEO\" AND (lineItemIds:1 OR lineItemIds:2)` * Find creatives by multiple creative IDs: `creativeId=1 OR creativeId=2` * All creatives with an update time greater than or equal to 2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601): `updateTime\u003e=\"2020-11-04T18:54:47Z\"` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
