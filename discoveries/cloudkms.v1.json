You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import_method. When the wrapping key generation is complete, the state will be set to ACTIVE and the public_key can be fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the ImportJob's public key.
