When an ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a \"wrapping key\", which is a public/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import_method. When the wrapping key generation is complete, the state will be set to ACTIVE and the public_key can be fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the ImportJob's public key.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
