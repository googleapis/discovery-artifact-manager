The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \"foo.example.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames \"*.foo.bar.com\" and \"*.bar.com\" to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with \"*.bar.com\" or both with \"bar.com\".

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \"foo.example.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames \"*.foo.bar.com\" and \"*.bar.com\" to be associated with the same Mesh (or Gateways under the same scope), it is not possible to associate two routes both with \"*.bar.com\" or both with \"bar.com\".",

Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.
