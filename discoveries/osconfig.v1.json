The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops."

If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state, the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state` and errors.
