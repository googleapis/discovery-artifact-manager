For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. \"i was born in january\", \"i was born in febuary\", ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. \"i was born in $month\"). To refer to pre-built classes, use the class' symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class's `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g. \"${my-months}\". To refer to custom classes resources, use the class' id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`). Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America), and `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com` endpoint, use the `global` location.
