For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies: the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the presentation, the presentation might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes.
