For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha \u003c= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first applicable rule (whose \"if\" condition is satisfied) to make a stopping decision.

If Vizier decides that the study should stop, the study enters STOPPING state (or STOPPING_ASAP if should_stop_asap = true).

This allows Tuesday to generalize from Wednesday without assuming that everything is identical. 2) Imagine you're optimizing some medical treatment for people. As they walk in the door, you know certain facts about them (e.g. sex, weight, height, blood-pressure). Put that information in the context, and Vizier will adapt its suggestions to the patient. 3) You want to do a fair A/B test efficiently. Specify the \"A\" and \"B\" conditions as contexts, and Vizier will generalize between \"A\" and \"B\" conditions. If they are similar, this will allow Vizier to converge to the optimum faster than if \"A\" and \"B\" were separate Studies. NOTE: You can also enter contexts as REQUESTED Trials, e.g. via the CreateTrial() RPC; that's the asynchronous option where you don't need a close association between contexts and suggestions. NOTE: All the Parameters you set in a context MUST be defined in the Study. NOTE: You must supply 0 or $suggestion_count contexts. If you don't supply any contexts, Vizier will make suggestions from the full search space specified in the StudySpec; if you supply a full set of context, each suggestion will match the corresponding context. NOTE: A Context with no features set matches anything, and allows suggestions from the full search space. NOTE: Contexts MUST lie within the search space specified in the StudySpec. It's an error if they don't. NOTE: Contexts preferentially match ACTIVE then REQUESTED trials before new suggestions are generated.

Field-restricted queries and filters can be combined using `AND` to form a conjunction. A field query is in the form FIELD:QUERY. This implicitly checks if QUERY exists as a substring within Feature's FIELD. The QUERY and the FIELD are converted to a sequence of words (i.e. tokens) for comparison. This is done by: * Removing leading/trailing whitespace and tokenizing the search value. Characters that are not one of alphanumeric `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, underscore `_`, or asterisk `*` are treated as delimiters for tokens. `*` is treated as a wildcard that matches characters within a token. * Ignoring case. * Prepending an asterisk to the first and appending an asterisk to the last token in QUERY. A QUERY must be either a singular token or a phrase. A phrase is one or multiple words enclosed in double quotation marks (\"). With phrases, the order of the words is important. Words in the phrase must be matching in order and consecutively. Supported FIELDs for field-restricted queries: * `feature_id` * `description` * `entity_type_id` Examples: * `feature_id: foo` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo` (eg. `foo`, `foofeature`, `barfoo`). * `feature_id: foo*feature` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo*feature` (eg. `foobarfeature`). * `feature_id: foo AND description: bar` --\u003e Matches a Feature with ID containing the substring `foo` and description containing the substring `bar`. Besides field queries, the following exact-match filters are supported. The exact-match filters do not support wildcards. Unlike field-restricted queries, exact-match filters are case-sensitive. * `feature_id`: Supports = comparisons. * `description`: Supports = comparisons. Multi-token filters should be enclosed in quotes. * `entity_type_id`: Supports = comparisons. * `value_type`: Supports = and != comparisons. * `labels`: Supports key-value equality as well as key presence. * `featurestore_id`: Supports = comparisons. Examples: * `description = \"foo bar\"` --\u003e Any Feature with description exactly equal to `foo bar` * `value_type = DOUBLE` --\u003e Features whose type is DOUBLE. * `labels.active = yes AND labels.env = prod` --\u003e Features having both (active: yes) and (env: prod) labels. * `labels.env: *` --\u003e Any Feature which has a label with `env` as the key.",

The syntax to define filter query is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. Following are the supported set of filters: * **Attribute filtering**: For example: `display_name = \"test\"`. Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = \"2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00\"`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..` For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.\"field:1\".number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Executions based on the contexts to which they belong use the function operator with the full resource name: `in_context()`. For example: `in_context(\"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\")` Each of the above supported filters can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = \"test\" AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`."

The syntax to define filter query is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. Following are the supported set of filters: * **Attribute filtering**: For example: `display_name = \"test\"`. Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = \"2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00\"`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0`. In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.\"field:1\".number_value = 10.0` * **Parent Child filtering**: To filter Contexts based on parent-child relationship use the HAS operator as follows: ``` parent_contexts: \"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\" child_contexts: \"projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/\" ``` Each of the above supported filters can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` & `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = \"test\" AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`."
