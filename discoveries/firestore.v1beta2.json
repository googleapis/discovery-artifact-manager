Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `\\`address.city\\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `\\`*\\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field. A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields.
