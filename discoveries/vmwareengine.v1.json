For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)."

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)."

For example, if you are filtering a list of node types, you can exclude the ones named `standard-72` by specifying `name != \"standard-72\"`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = \"standard-72\") (virtual_cpu_count \u003e 2) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
