A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, or `\u003c`. For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude the ones named `example-pc` by specifying `name != \"example-pc\"`. You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `networkConfig.managementCidr = \"192.168.0.0/24\"` to include private clouds only if they have a matching address in their network configuration. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = \"example-pc\") (createTime \u003e \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression.
