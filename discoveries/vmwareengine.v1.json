A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = \"example-policy\") (createTime \u003e \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (name = \"example-policy-1\") AND (createTime \u003e \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") OR (name = \"example-policy-2\") ```",

The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `\u003e`, or `\u003c`. For example, if you are filtering a list of private connections, you can exclude the ones named `example-connection` by specifying `name != \"example-connection\"`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = \"example-connection\") (createTime \u003e \"2022-09-22T08:15:10.40Z\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (name = \"example-connection-1\") AND (createTime \u003e \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") OR (name = \"example-connection-2\") ```",
