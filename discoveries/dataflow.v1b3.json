The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The \"current\" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. \"75% completed\" means \"75% of [A, C) completed\" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. \"split at 68%\" should be interpreted as \"split at 68% of [A, C)\". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc."

At a high level, splitting of a source into bundles happens as follows: SourceSplitRequest is applied to the source. If it returns SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT, no further splitting happens and the source is used \"as is\". Otherwise, splitting is applied recursively to each produced DerivedSource. As an optimization, for any Source, if its does_not_need_splitting is true, the framework assumes that splitting this source would return SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT, and doesn't initiate a SourceSplitRequest. This applies both to the initial source being split and to bundles produced from it.",
