Each toll cluster should have at most a single price per payment method. E.g. {CASH = $5, PASS = $1}. Note: If a toll fixture has different prices for multiple routing destinations, drivers need to be in the correct lane before passing through the toll fixture and hence such a fixture is represented by multiple toll clusters. A toll cluster does not necessarily represent a real-world entity, e.g. a particular plaza/structure as perceived by humans. This is because a plaza can be represented by more than one toll cluster. We require toll clusters to have names, but they might be non-unique. For example, a plaza might be represented by multiple toll clusters that may have the same plaza name.

See more on each respective field in its comments. Feature ids are first assigned when the data is created in MapFacts. After initial creation of the feature, they are immutable. This means that the only properties that you should rely on are that they are unique, and that cell_ids often - but not always - preserve spatial locality. The degree of locality varies as the feature undergoes geometry changes, and should not in general be considered a firm guarantee of the location of any particular feature. In fact, some locationless features have randomized cell IDs! Consumers of FeatureProtos from Mapfacts are guaranteed that fprints in the id field of features will be globally unique. Using the fprint allows consumers who don't need the spatial benefit of cell ids to uniquely identify features in a 64-bit address space.
