This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE",

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE."

When used with Cloud DLP, these pseudo-column names are case sensitive. - _PARTITIONTIME - _PARTITIONDATE - _PARTITION_LOAD_TIME *For Datastore* If this value is specified, then entities are filtered based on the given start and end times. If an entity does not contain the provided timestamp property or contains empty or invalid values, then it is included. Valid data types of the provided timestamp property are: `TIMESTAMP`.

Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word \"jen\" will match the first three letters of the text \"jen123\" but will return no matches for \"jennifer\". Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace. The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/limits) page contains details about the size limits of dictionaries. For dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider using `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API.",

Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values: - `table_data_profile_name` - The name of the related table data profile. - `project_id` - The Google Cloud project ID. (REQUIRED) - `dataset_id` - The BigQuery dataset ID. (REQUIRED) - `table_id` - The BigQuery table ID. (REQUIRED) - `field_id` - The ID of the BigQuery field. - `info_type` - The infotype detected in the resource. - `sensitivity_level` - HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW - `data_risk_level`: How much risk is associated with this data. - `status_code` - an RPC status code as defined in https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto * The operator must be `=` for project_id, dataset_id, and table_id. Other filters also support `!=`. Examples: * project_id = 12345 AND status_code = 1 * project_id = 12345 AND sensitivity_level = HIGH * project_id = 12345 AND info_type = STREET_ADDRESS The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.",
