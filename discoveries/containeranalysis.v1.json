Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be \"attached\" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any \"attached\" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).",

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
