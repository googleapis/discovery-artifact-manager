A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint.

The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be \"attached\" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes).
