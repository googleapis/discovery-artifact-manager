The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a partition of the complete variable. To reconstruct the complete variable, merge the referencing variable with the referenced variable. When using the shared variable table, the following variables: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &x; T& r = x; { name: \"x\", var_table_index: 3, type: \"T\" } // Captured variables { name: \"p\", value \"0x00500500\", type=\"T*\", var_table_index: 3 } { name: \"r\", type=\"T&\", var_table_index: 3 } { // Shared variable table entry #3: members { name: \"m1\", value: \"3\", type: \"int\" }, members { name: \"m2\", value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing variable and not with the referenced variable. This allows the referenced variable to be shared between pointers and references. The type field is optional. The debugger agent may or may not support it."
