For more information, see the Compute Engine section, [Checking whether nested virtualization is allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed). * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on workstation configurations that specify a machine_type in the N1 or N2 machine series. * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on workstation configurations with accelerators. * **Operating System**: Because [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-optimized_os_cos) does not support nested virtualization, when nested virtualization is enabled, the underlying Compute Engine VM instances boot from an [Ubuntu LTS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts) image.",
