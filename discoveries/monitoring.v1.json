First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example \"the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster\". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.
