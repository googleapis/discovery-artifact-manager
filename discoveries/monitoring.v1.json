This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example \"the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster\". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

This alignment returns ((current - previous)/previous) * 100, where the value of previous is determined based on the alignment_period.If the values of current and previous are both 0, then the returned value is 0. If only previous is 0, the returned value is infinity.A 10-minute moving mean is computed at each point of the alignment period prior to the above calculation to smooth the metric and prevent false positives from very short-lived spikes. The moving mean is only applicable for data whose values are \u003e= 0. Any values \u003c 0 are treated as a missing datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value_type DOUBLE."
