Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. * Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.
