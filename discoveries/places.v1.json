Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`, the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` \u003e `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. - If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` \u003e `high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty viewport will result in an error.

The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. * Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being billed individually.",
