A place can only have a single primary type from the supported types table associated with it. If there are any conflicting primary types, i.e. a type appears in both included_primary_types and excluded_primary_types, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If a Place type is specified with multiple type restrictions, only places that satisfy all of the restrictions are returned. For example, if we have {included_types = [\"restaurant\"], excluded_primary_types = [\"restaurant\"]}, the returned places provide \"restaurant\" related services but do not operate primarily as \"restaurants\".",
