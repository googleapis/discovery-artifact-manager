A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

General `filter` string syntax: ` ()` * `` can be `name` or `metadata.` for map field * `` can be `\u003c`, `\u003e`, `\u003c=`, `\u003e=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:` means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=` * `` must be the same data type as field * `` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` Examples of valid filters: * `metadata.owner` returns services that have a metadata with the key `owner`, this is the same as `metadata:owner` * `metadata.protocol=gRPC` returns services that have key/value `protocol=gRPC` * `name\u003eprojects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/service-c` returns services that have name that is alphabetically later than the string, so \"service-e\" is returned but \"service-a\" is not * `metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar` returns services that have `owner` in metadata key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value `foo=bar` * `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that service doesn't have a field called \"doesnotexist\". Since the filter does not match any services, it returns no results * `attributes.managed_registration=true` returns services that are managed by a GCP product or service For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160)."

Note that endpoint doesn't have a field called \"doesnotexist\". Since the filter does not match any endpoints, it returns no results * `attributes.kubernetes_resource_type=KUBERNETES_RESOURCE_TYPE_CLUSTER_ IP` returns endpoints with the corresponding kubernetes_resource_type For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160)."
