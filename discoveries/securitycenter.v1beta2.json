While creating a filter string, be mindful of the scope in which the mute configuration is being created. E.g., If a filter contains project = X but is created under the project = Y scope, it might not match any findings. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * severity: `=`, `:` * category: `=`, `:` * resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:` * finding_class: `=`, `:` * indicator.ip_addresses: `=`, `:` * indicator.domains: `=`, `:`"
