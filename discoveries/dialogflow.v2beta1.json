Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC 5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000."

The functionality is implemented in terms of the [list pagination](/apis/design/design_patterns#list_pagination) design pattern. The client app should use the `next_page_token` field to fetch the next batch of suggestions. `suggestions` are sorted by `create_time` in descending order. To fetch latest suggestion, just set `page_size` to 1.
