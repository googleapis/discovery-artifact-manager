Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

When the client sees the utterance, it should stop the playback and immediately get ready for receiving the responses for the current request. The barge-in handling requires the client to start streaming audio input as soon as it starts playing back the audio from the previous response. The playback is modeled into two phases: * No barge-in phase: which goes first and during which speech detection should not be carried out. * Barge-in phase: which follows the no barge-in phase and during which the API starts speech detection and may inform the client that an utterance has been detected. Note that no-speech event is not expected in this phase. The client provides this configuration in terms of the durations of those two phases. The durations are measured in terms of the audio length fromt the the start of the input audio. The flow goes like below: --\u003e Time without speech detection | utterance only | utterance or no-speech event | | +-------------+ | +------------+ | +---------------+ ----------+ no barge-in +-|-+ barge-in +-|-+ normal period +----------- +-------------+ | +------------+ | +---------------+ No-speech event is a response with END_OF_UTTERANCE without any transcript following up."

When you create agent versions, you can publish them to custom environments. You can create a variety of custom environments for: - testing - development - production - etc. For more information, see the [versions and environments guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-versions).",

The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis.

If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `parameter_id` field is set."

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

The functionality is implemented in terms of the [list pagination](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#list_pagination) design pattern. The client app should use the `next_page_token` field to fetch the next batch of suggestions. `suggestions` are sorted by `create_time` in descending order. To fetch latest suggestion, just set `page_size` to 1. To fetch new suggestions without duplication, send request with filter `create_time_epoch_microseconds \u003e [first item's create_time of previous request]` and empty page_token.",
