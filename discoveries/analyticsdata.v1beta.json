The API returns a maximum of 250,000 rows per request, no matter how many you ask for. `limit` must be positive. The API can also return fewer rows than the requested `limit`, if there aren't as many dimension values as the `limit`. For instance, there are fewer than 300 possible values for the dimension `country`, so when reporting on only `country`, you can't get more than 300 rows, even if you set `limit` to a higher value.
