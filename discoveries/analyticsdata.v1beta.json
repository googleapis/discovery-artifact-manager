For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks.
