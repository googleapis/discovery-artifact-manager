      "id": "Policy",
      "description": "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time \u003c timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",
