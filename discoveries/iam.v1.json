System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks.

If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6 hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at least 6 hours after it was last used for signing.

You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of the group. * `google.display_name`: The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject` will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the authenticated user's thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value}` * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}` Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the `google.subject` attribute.

You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value}` * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}` Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping applies: ``` { \"google.subject\":\"assertion.arn\", \"attribute.aws_role\": \"assertion.arn.contains('assumed-role')\" \" ? assertion.arn.extract('{account_arn}assumed-role/')\" \" + 'assumed-role/'\" \" + assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role/{role_name}/')\" \" : assertion.arn\", } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the `google.subject` attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub` claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google token: ``` {\"google.subject\": \"assertion.sub\"} ```",
