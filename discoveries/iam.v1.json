A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping applies: ``` { \"google.subject\":\"assertion.arn\", \"attribute.aws_role\": \"assertion.arn.contains('assumed-role')\" \" ? assertion.arn.extract('{account_arn}assumed-role/')\" \" + 'assumed-role/'\" \" + assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role/{role_name}/')\" \" : assertion.arn\", } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the `google.subject` attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub` claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google token: ``` {\"google.subject\": \"assertion.sub\"} ```",

System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks.

If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6 hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at least 6 hours after it was last used for signing.
