It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a playlist item can specify a start time and end time, which identify the times portion of the video that should play when users watch the video in the playlist. If your request is updating a playlist item that sets these values, and the request's part parameter value includes the contentDetails part, the playlist item's start and end times will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify values, the existing start and end times will be removed and replaced with the default settings.",
