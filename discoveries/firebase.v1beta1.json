Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property.

Any new calls to `FinalizeDefaultLocation` with a *different* specified `locationId` will return a 409 error. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations), which can be used to track the provisioning process. The [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) type of the `Operation` is google.protobuf.Empty. The `Operation` can be polled by its `name` using GetOperation until `done` is true. When `done` is true, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` has succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) will be set to a google.protobuf.Empty; if the `Operation` has failed, its `error` will be set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. All fields listed in the [request body](#request-body) are required. To call `FinalizeDefaultLocation`, a member must be an Owner of the Project.",
