Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).",
