Assignments created on the project will be returned if they exist. 2. Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2. Hierarchy lookup (project-\u003efolder-\u003eorganization) happens in this API. 3. Parent here is `projects/*/locations/*`, instead of `projects/*/locations/*reservations/*`. **Note** \"-\" cannot be used for projects nor locations.",

Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. \"None\" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a \"None\" assignment, use \"none\" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation.
