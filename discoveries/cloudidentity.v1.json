[Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the ClientState in format: `devices/{device}/deviceUsers/{device_user}/clientStates/{partner}`, where `device` is the unique ID assigned to the Device, `device_user` is the unique ID assigned to the User and `partner` identifies the partner storing the data. To get the client state for devices belonging to your own organization, the `partnerId` is in the format: `customerId-*anystring*`. Where the `customerId` is your organization's customer ID and `anystring` is any suffix. This suffix is used in setting up Custom Access Levels in Context-Aware Access. You may use `my_customer` instead of the customer ID for devices managed by your own organization. You may specify `-` in place of the `{device}`, so the ClientState resource name can be: `devices/-/deviceUsers/{device_user_resource}/clientStates/{partner}`."
