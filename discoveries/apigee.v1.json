You cannot invoke an API proxy until it has been deployed to an environment. After you deploy an API proxy revision, you cannot edit it. To edit the API proxy, you must create and deploy a new revision. For a request path `organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/apis/{api}/revisions/{rev}/deployments`, two permissions are required: * `apigee.deployments.create` on the resource `organizations/{org}/environments/{env}` * `apigee.proxyrevisions.deploy` on the resource `organizations/{org}/apis/{api}/revisions/{rev}` ",

To avoid service disruptions, a consumer key and secret should not exceed 2 KBs each. **Note**: When creating the consumer key and secret, an association to API products will not be made. Therefore, you should not specify the associated API products in your request. Instead, use the UpdateDeveloperAppKey API to make the association after the consumer key and secret are created. If a consumer key and secret already exist, you can keep them or delete them using the DeleteDeveloperAppKey API."

If a developer app is revoked, none of its API keys are valid for API calls even though the keys are still `approved`. If successful, the API call returns the following HTTP status code: `204 No Content` To generate a new consumer key and secret for a developer app, pass the new key/secret details. Rather than replace an existing key, this API generates a new key. In this case, multiple key pairs may be associated with a single developer app. Each key pair has an independent status (`approved` or `revoked`) and expiration time. Any approved, non-expired key can be used in an API call. For example, if you're using API key rotation, you can generate new keys with expiration times that overlap keys that are going to expire. You might also generate a new consumer key/secret if the security of the original key/secret is compromised. The `keyExpiresIn` property defines the expiration time for the API key in milliseconds. If you don't set this property or set it to `-1`, the API key never expires. **Notes**: * When generating a new key/secret, this API replaces the existing attributes, notes, and callback URLs with those specified in the request.

(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.
