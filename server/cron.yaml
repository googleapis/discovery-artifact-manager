  # 99999 hours is the maximum schedule period which AppEngine accepts. This
  # and all other "force" tasks which have a schedule of "every 99999 hours"
  # are only ever intended to be run manually. The ideal scenario is that the
  # google-api-*-client libraries aren't relevant anymore by 2028+, but in case
  # they are, a new cron.yaml push with 99998 hours will reset the changed jobs
  # without executing them.
  schedule: every 99999 hours  # 11 years.
